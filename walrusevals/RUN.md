# Run Walrus Evals on yourself

42 questions a Walrus developer would actually type, each one cited to the
documentation page it grades against.
This file is the whole protocol. If you are an agent with a shell, you can follow it
start to finish without asking anyone anything.

The point of the exercise is not your rank. It is the gap between what you answer
with nothing in context and what you answer with the Walrus skills loaded. That gap is
the only number here that says anything about whether Walrus is documented well.
**So run it twice.**

Two ways to finish: **submit your answers** and let the same judge that grades every
other run grade yours, or grade them yourself. The first is a row on the board. The
second is a row beside it, labelled self-graded, that nothing can be compared with.

---

## 1. See the suite

```sh
node walrusevals/list.js                  # the worklist, grouped by pillar
node walrusevals/list.js --skill walrus-cli   # one skill
node walrusevals/list.js --json           # machine-readable
```

Each eval has a qualified id (`walrus-cli/cli-store-basic`), a prompt, and a
numbered list of expectations. **Ids are qualified by skill.** Scoring anything by
a bare id would silently merge two skills' questions if two ever shared a name.

## 2. Answer every prompt

Answer each `Q:` as you would answer a developer who asked it. Prose and code, the
length a real reply takes. Do not look at the expectations until you have written
the answer, and do not fetch the cited source pages. This measures what you know
and what the skill in your context taught you, not what you can retrieve.

**Run 1, baseline.** Nothing about Walrus in your context. No skill files, no
`CLAUDE.md` that mentions Walrus, no earlier turns in this conversation about Walrus.

**Answer each question more than once if you can.** One answer is a sample, not a
census: the same model gives different answers to the same question, and a gap
between two runs smaller than that variation is not a gap. The board reports how far
a score moves across identical attempts, and a submission that did the same carries
more weight than one that did not. Three attempts is useful; ten is enough to quote.

**Run 2, with the skills.** Before answering a skill's evals, read that skill's
`SKILL.md` and every other `.md` beside it, and keep them in context while you
answer. A `walrus-cli` eval is answered with `walrus-cli/` loaded, not with all
twelve skills loaded:
the suite asks whether *that* skill teaches *that* answer.

## 3. Submit the answers, not a grade

**This is the path that gets you on the board.** Put what your model said into an
answers file and let the same judge that grades every other run grade yours.

```sh
node walrusevals/list.js --answers > my-answers.json
```

Fill in one answer per eval id, set `model` (`claude-opus-5`), `skills` (`none` for
run 1, `walrus-skills` for run 2) and `submitted_by`, then:

```sh
node walrusevals/validate.js my-answers.json
cp my-answers.json walrusevals/results/claude-opus-5-with-skills.answers.json
```

Open a pull request with both answers files. A maintainer runs the judge over them
and commits the resulting cards. The grading costs money per eval, so it is a manual
step rather than something a pull request triggers, but the card it produces is in
**the same grading regime as every run already on the board**, which is what makes
it rank rather than sit beside the ranking.

`validate.js` checks the answers before any of that: an id that is not in the suite,
an eval left unanswered, or a file where most answers are empty. A run where the
model said nothing is not a run that scored badly, and it is worth finding that out
before 42 judge calls rather than after.

## 4. Or grade it yourself

You can, and the result is published, and it will not be ranked.

```sh
node walrusevals/list.js --template > my-grades.json     # one boolean per expectation
node walrusevals/score.js --grades my-grades.json
```

Fill in each array. An expectation is satisfied or it is not; there is no partial
credit inside one. Grade strictly: "mentions X" means the answer says X, not that it
says something adjacent to X. If an eval carries a `graders` entry, those
expectations have a written pattern and are settled by matching it, with no opinion
involved. Set `graded_by` to `self`, `human`, or `judge:<model>`.

**A model marking its own paper is the easier of two measurements**, so the board
keeps self-graded cards out of the judge-graded ranking and labels them. That is not
a punishment, it is the only honest thing to do with two different rulers, but it
does mean a self-graded card is a row nobody can read against anything. If you have
a second model to hand, `judge:<that model>` is better, and submitting the answers
is better still.

`score.js` prints the per-pillar report and the evals you missed, worst first. It
refuses a grades file whose arrays are the wrong length or whose ids are not in the
suite, because both produce a plausible number over a denominator nobody else has.

The score is **the mean of the four pillar scores**, not the pooled pass rate.
Building holds 20 of the 42 evals and Fundamentals 6, so pooling lets one pillar
decide the number and a weak showing on what storage costs disappears into it.

```sh
node walrusevals/score.js --grades my-grades.json \
  --out walrusevals/results/claude-opus-5-with-skills.json \
  --submitted-by your-github-handle
node walrusevals/validate.js
```

The card records the suite's fingerprint either way, so a run made before the evals
changed is marked as against an older set rather than silently compared with a
current one.

## What a card contains

```json
{
  "walrusevals_card": 1,
  "model": "claude-opus-5",
  "skills": "walrus-skills",
  "harness": "self-report",
  "graded_by": "self",
  "manifest": "143c0d0525d3",
  "recorded_at": "2026-10-02T15:00:00.000Z",
  "submitted_by": "your-github-handle",
  "pillars": { "fundamentals": { "pass": 20, "total": 26 }, "…": {} },
  "total": { "pass": 613, "total": 896 },
  "evals": [{ "id": "walrus-cli/cli-store-basic", "pass": 4, "of": 5 }]
}
```

`score.js` writes it. Writing one by hand is possible and not advised: the pillar
totals have to agree with the per-eval rows, and `validate.js` will tell you when
they do not.

## Things worth knowing before you argue with a result

- **An eval you fail may be a bad eval.** Every expectation is supposed to be
  sourced: written from a documentation page, with that page linked on the eval. If
  an expectation is not supported by the page it cites, that is a bug in the suite.
  Open an issue or a pull request against the eval. Several have been rewritten this
  way.
- **The pillars are uneven** because the evals were written per skill and grouped
  afterwards. Scoring averages the four, so the unevenness does not reach the score.

- **Nothing in this directory calls a model.** These scripts read files and do
  arithmetic. You are the model under test. The one thing that does call a model is
  the judge, which runs on a maintainer's machine over submitted answers.
