/**
 * Adding a baseline run must not move a capability figure.
 *
 * The page carries two kinds of number and they are easy to mix. A capability
 * figure says how well a model does the job, and only means anything over runs in
 * the configuration a developer would use -- the skills loaded. A comparison figure
 * says what the documentation is worth, and only means anything over a model run
 * both ways.
 *
 * Every figure was computed over "every run", which was correct for exactly as long
 * as every run was a with-skills run. The first baseline card breaks it silently:
 * "best minus worst" becomes the distance between the best model holding the
 * documentation and one that was never given it, under a caption about which model
 * to reach for, and the number moves with nothing on the page to say why. It went
 * from 53 points to 57 in the simulation that found this.
 *
 * So this runs the page's own renderers twice against the published results -- once
 * as they are, once with baseline cards added -- and asserts the capability figures
 * are identical and only the comparison figure appears.
