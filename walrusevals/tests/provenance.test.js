/**
 * Official and community cards are different rows, and "official" is not a
 * default anyone falls into.
 *
 * The board labels a card by who measured it. Before provenance was part of the
 * run's identity it was only part of the filename, and the board ignores
 * filenames -- it keys on model and skills. So a contributor re-running a model
 * the pipeline had already measured produced a second row with the same name,
 * whose record page overwrote the first: two measurements, one file, and no way
 * to tell which one survived. The repository's own control runs already have
 * that shape (claude-sonnet-5.json and claude-sonnet-5-faspec.json are both
 * claude-sonnet-5 with walrus-skills).
