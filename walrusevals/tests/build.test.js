/**
 * The generated catalogue and cards have to agree with each other.
 *
 * The bug this exists to stop: eval ids are only unique within a skill --
 * twenty skills number theirs 1, 2, 3 -- so keying a Map on the bare id kept
 * whichever skill was read last, and every card's pillar breakdown came out of
 * the wrong pillars. It looked plausible: the totals still summed to the suite's count, so
 * nothing was obviously broken. Security showed 79 of a 16-eval pillar.
