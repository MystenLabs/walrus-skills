 * Builds the two files WALRUSEVALS serves: the eval catalogue and the results.
 *
 *   evals/index.json    every eval in the suite, with its pillar and how it is
 *                       graded. Generated from the skills repo, so the site
 *                       cannot claim an eval that does not exist.
 *   results/index.json  one card per run. Generated from the per-model result
 *                       files the skills eval already writes, so the
 *                       leaderboard is the same data CI produces rather than a
 *                       second set of numbers that can disagree with it.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node walrusevals/build.js --skills . --out walrusevals
 *
 * Nothing here calls a model. It reads what has already been run.
