/**
 * A card: one run of the suite, in the shape the board reads.
 *
 * Cards arrive by pull request from people running the suite on their own model,
 * so every field the board relies on is checked here rather than trusted. The
 * checks that matter are not about JSON shape:
 *
 *   - An id that is not in the suite means the run scored something that does not
 *     exist, usually because ids were invented per skill and collided.
 *   - A grade array of the wrong length means expectations were skipped or
 *     doubled, and the pass rate is over a denominator nobody else has.
 *   - A run covering part of the suite is not a lower score, it is a different
 *     measurement, so it is marked rather than ranked.
 *   - A suite fingerprint that does not match means the evals changed after the
 *     run, and the card is shown as against an older set instead of beside
 *     current ones.

 * blocked the pull request. Three parts of this system treat a stale card as

 * red because of 24 cards measured before #106 renamed the suite.
 *
 * A stale card is still not ranked -- build.js refuses it on coverage, because
 * its ids no longer join. That is the protection. Failing CI as well protected
 * nothing and hid real failures behind a permanent one.
